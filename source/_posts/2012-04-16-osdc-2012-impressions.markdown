Last weekend I joined [OSDC.TW 2012][osdc] (Open Source Developers' Conference) in Sinica Academia, Taipei. It was a 2-day event (April 14-15, 2012) with 7 keynote speeches, 9 sessions (departed to 3 mini-confs for each, 27 topics in total), and 9 lightning talks. Here is the [official agenda][agenda]. This article is a brief summary for myself, and it also covers certain impressions that I had got, if any, in each agenda.

#Day 1
When I took highway bus and made to transit to Nangang, it was almost 9:30 AM. I felt regretful since the session opened at 9, and since the truth that I did not plan it well. Then I took another 15 minutes walking, which Google Map told me to do so, to Sinica Academia. Anyway, it was a deadly cloudy morning with regrets for missing the first keynote speech.

After taking the attendee's badge and a crappy nonwoven Samsung bag, I managed to enter the main conference hall. The second session was just about to begin.

###Impressions
It was the session I missed. What's worse, there wasn't much discussion on IRC for me to catch up, so I could only took a glance on the slide.
It looks like that this talk was more of a general overview about what Mizilla's current endaevour than a technical talk. The summary was wrapped-up in the end of slide:
	*	Mozilla is committed to keep the mobile web free and open as it did to the desktop web
	*	Join the project and/or partner with Mozilla to break the looming mobile monopoly!
	*	Mozilla Taiwan is a key driver for B2G, and they are hiring
